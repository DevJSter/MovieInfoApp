### Movie Info App
 I am gonna showing to you how to code a movie info app with javascript. in this tutorial also we use a movie database api and we get data from api and this code is also responsive❗️

## Warning
You need to get your own api key (in video we showed how!) and replace it in key.js file :

```javascript
key = "Your Api Key";
```
